# Data Description

This study is based on a real-world liner shipping alliance consisting of 13 service routes. Each route is operated by vessels deployed by 2 to 4 shipping companies. The dataset includes origin–destination (OD) demand and freight rate information, collected from publicly available sources([web](https://lines.coscoshipping.com/)), collaborative projects with shipping companies, and synthetically generated data to supplement incomplete observations.

The dataset is organized into four main components:
1. The liner service network (available in [web](https://lines.coscoshipping.com/));
2. Port information;
3. OD demand data for four shipping companies;
4. OD freight rate for the four companies.
